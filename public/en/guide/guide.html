            <div class="text-content">
                <div class="title" id="os">What is an Operating System (OS)?</div>
                An operating system is the core software that acts as the brain of a computer. To explain what an operating system does in simple terms: when you click a mouse or press a keyboard, it receives those signals and delivers them to the appropriate programs, and makes sure programs can display results on the screen. It also efficiently allocates memory and storage space, and allows multiple programs to run simultaneously.

                Just as smartphones have Android or iOS, computers have operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. Without an operating system, you cannot use a computer, and different operating systems have slightly different usage methods. The operating system is the first thing that runs when you turn on a computer, and all other programs operate on top of the operating system.

                <div class="title" id="linux">What is Linux?</div>
                Linux is a free operating system developed collaboratively by developers around the world. It was first created by Finnish university student Linus Torvalds in 1991, and now countless people participate in its development.

                While Windows is a product made and sold by one company called Microsoft, Linux can be used by anyone for free, and even its internal structure is publicly available. This is like the difference between a dish made with a public recipe and one made with a secret recipe.

                While Windows focuses on graphical interfaces to make it easy for users to use, Linux has strengths in stability, security, and user-customizable settings. In Windows, most tasks are done with mouse clicks, but in Linux, text commands are often entered directly.

                Linux is particularly popular on server computers. Most websites on the internet run on Linux servers, and Android smartphones are actually based on Linux. Developers and system administrators prefer Linux because of its powerful features, high stability, and the fact that it's free.

                <div class="title" id="gui-cli">GUI vs CLI - Computer Usage Methods</div>
                GUI and CLI are two different ways of communicating with computers.

                GUI is a graphical user interface, which is the screen we typically see when using computers. It's the method of clicking icons with a mouse, opening and closing windows, and selecting menus. Windows desktop and Mac's Finder are representative examples of GUI. It's intuitive and easy to learn, so even computer beginners can use it easily.

                CLI is a command-line interface, a method of communicating with computers by directly entering text commands. You may have seen in movies the image of typing commands with white text on a black screen. It may seem difficult at first, but once you get used to it, you can work very quickly and accurately.

                The advantages of CLI are speed and precision. Tasks that would require multiple mouse clicks can be completed with a single line of command, and when repeating the same task, you can easily execute it by copying commands. Also, CLI is much more efficient when managing other computers remotely.

                Linux supports both GUI and CLI, so you can choose the interface you need.

                <div class="title" id="opensource">Understanding Open Source and Free Software</div>
                Open source means making the source code, which is the blueprint of software, publicly available for anyone to see. It's like making cooking recipes available to everyone. Anyone can look at these recipes and make the dish, and they can also improve the recipe to make it tastier.

                Traditional software is a product made and sold by companies. The source code is a company secret, and users only purchase and use the finished program. However, open source software has its source code publicly available, so anyone can check its internal structure and modify or improve it as needed.

                Free software is similar to open source but is a more philosophical concept. It emphasizes users' rights to freely use, copy, modify, and distribute software. Here, "free" doesn't mean free of charge, but rather the freedom to use it freely.

                Linux is a representative example of both open source and free software. Countless developers around the world voluntarily participate in its development, and anyone can use it for free. Thanks to this collaborative development method, Linux is very stable and has excellent security. Because many people review the code, bugs or security issues can be quickly discovered and resolved.

                <div class="title" id="filesystem">Understanding File System Structure</div>
                Linux's file system has a structure like a giant tree. There's a root at the top, and branches extend from there. This root is called the root and is represented by a single slash symbol (/).

                Under the root, there are several important folders. The home folder is each user's personal space. It plays a similar role to Windows' My Documents folder. If a user's name is kim, then the /home/kim folder becomes that user's personal space. Personal files and settings are stored here.

                The etc folder is where system configuration files are gathered. It stores rules about how the computer should operate. It's like a building's management office. Important system information such as network settings, user information, and program settings are located here.

                The bin folder contains basic command programs. The actual program files for frequently used commands like ls, cp, mv are stored here. The usr folder is where user-installed programs go, and the var folder stores files whose contents change frequently, like log files.

                Thanks to this structured system, files can be managed systematically, and it's easy to find where any file is located. It may seem complex at first, but once you understand the rules, you can see that it's a very logical and efficient structure.

                <div class="title" id="package-manager">What is a Package Manager?</div>
                A package manager is a tool that installs and manages software. It plays a similar role to smartphone app stores. In Windows, when installing programs, you need to download installation files from the internet and run them, but in Linux, package managers automatically handle all these processes.

                The biggest advantage of package managers is dependency management. Many programs require other programs or libraries to run. For example, a music program might need audio processing libraries. Package managers automatically understand these relationships and install all necessary components together.

                Different Linux distributions use different package managers. Ubuntu and Debian use APT. If you type apt install firefox, Firefox browser will be automatically installed. Red Hat and CentOS use YUM or DNF, and Arch Linux uses Pacman.

                Using package managers makes software updates very easy too. With a single command, you can update all programs on your system to their latest versions. Also, when removing programs, it cleanly deletes all related files, keeping the system tidy. Because of this convenience, Linux users greatly prefer package managers.

                <div class="title" id="terminal">What is a Terminal?</div>
                A terminal is a window where you can have text conversations with your computer. That black screen with white text where you type commands is the terminal. Like chatting with a computer, when you enter commands, the computer shows results in text.

                The history of terminals is very old. It has been used since the days when computers didn't have mice or graphic screens. Back then, terminals were the only way to use computers. Now graphic interfaces have developed, but terminals remain very powerful and useful tools.

                There are several reasons to use terminals. First, they're fast. Tasks that would require multiple mouse clicks can be completed with a single line of command. Second, they're precise. Running the same command repeatedly always produces the same result. Third, automation is possible. You can connect multiple commands to automatically handle complex tasks.

                Terminals are particularly important in Linux. Most advanced tasks such as system management, program installation, and file management are done through terminals. It may seem difficult at first, but learning basic commands allows you to use computers much more efficiently. It's an essential tool that developers and system administrators cannot do without.

                <div class="title" id="cli-commands">Learning Basic CLI Commands</div>
                Learning frequently used basic commands in Linux terminals allows you to use computers much more efficiently. These commands are basic tools for managing files and folders.

                The ls command shows a list of files and folders in the current location. It's like opening Windows Explorer to view files. If you type ls -l, you can see detailed information about files as well.

                The cd command is used to move between folders. If you type cd Documents, you move to the Documents folder. cd .. moves to the parent folder, and typing just cd returns you to the user's home folder.

                cp is a command for copying files. If you type cp file1.txt file2.txt, it copies file1.txt and creates it with the name file2.txt. mv is used to move files or change names. mv old.txt new.txt changes the file name, and mv file.txt /home/user/ moves the file to another folder.

                rm is a command for deleting files. If you type rm file.txt, that file will be deleted. Note that Linux doesn't have a recycle bin, so deleted files are difficult to recover. mkdir is a command for creating new folders. If you type mkdir newfolder, a folder named newfolder will be created.

                sudo is used when executing commands with administrator privileges. It's needed when modifying system files or installing programs. It's used by placing it before other commands, like sudo apt install firefox.

                <div class="title" id="text-editor">Introduction to Text Editors</div>
                Text editors are very important tools in Linux. They're used for modifying configuration files, writing program code, or creating simple notes. There are several text editors that can be used directly in terminals.

                nano is the easiest terminal text editor to use. If you type nano filename.txt, you can edit that file. Shortcuts are displayed at the bottom of the screen, making it easy for beginners to use. You can save and exit by pressing Ctrl+X. nano is most suitable for simple file editing.

                vim is a very powerful but difficult-to-learn editor. It's a tool preferred by professional developers and system administrators. vim's characteristic is that all tasks can be done with just the keyboard. You can edit text very quickly without using a mouse at all. However, it takes time to get used to due to its unique operation method.

                vim has several modes. When first launched, it's in command mode, where you can't directly input text and can only perform commands like cursor movement or deletion. Pressing i switches to input mode where you can enter text. Pressing ESC returns to command mode.

                emacs is another famous text editor along with vim. It's a bit more intuitive than vim but still difficult to learn. Each editor has its own unique advantages and characteristics, so you can choose according to your needs and preferences. If you're a beginner, it's good to start with nano and gradually learn other editors.

                <div class="title" id="process">How to Manage Processes</div>
                A process refers to a currently running program. When multiple programs are running simultaneously on a computer, each running program is one process. Linux provides various tools to manage and monitor these processes.

                The ps command shows a list of currently running processes. Typing just ps shows only processes running in the current terminal, but typing ps aux shows all processes on the system. Each process has a unique number called PID, and you can check information such as who ran it, when it started, and how many resources it's using.

                The top command is a tool that shows process status in real-time. It plays a similar role to Windows Task Manager. You can check in real-time which processes are using a lot of CPU and which are taking up a lot of memory. You can exit top by pressing q.

                htop is a better-looking and easier-to-use version than top. It's color-coded and can be operated with a mouse, making it more intuitive. However, it's not installed by default and needs to be installed separately.

                The kill command is used to terminate processes. When a program stops and doesn't respond, you can forcibly terminate it. You terminate by specifying the process PID like kill 1234. You can also terminate by program name like killall firefox. Using these tools, you can understand the system's status and safely terminate problematic programs.

                <div class="title" id="ip-dns-port">Understanding IP, DNS, and Port Concepts</div>
                In the networking world, IP, DNS, and ports are core elements of internet communication. Understanding these helps you know how the internet works.

                An IP address is a unique address that each computer on the internet has. It's like a house address used when sending mail. It consists of four numbers separated by dots, like 192.168.1.1. All devices connected to the internet have such IP addresses, and they can communicate with each other through these addresses. The router you use at home also has an IP address, and your smartphone or laptop each receive unique IP addresses to use the internet.

                DNS is the Domain Name System, a service that converts IP addresses into names that people can easily remember. Website addresses we commonly use like siliod.com or google.com are domain names. Actually, Google also has a specific IP address, but since it's difficult to memorize numerical IP addresses, DNS converts them to domain names. It's like finding a phone number by name in a phone book.

                A port is a number that distinguishes multiple services within one computer. Just as one building has multiple room numbers, one computer with one IP address can run multiple services simultaneously. Web servers usually use port 80, and email servers use port 25. When accessing websites, you can specify the port number like www.example.com:80, but since the web basically uses port 80, it can be omitted.

                <div class="title" id="common-errors">Common Errors and Solutions</div>
                When using Linux, you'll encounter various error messages. It may be confusing at first, but most errors follow a few patterns and have similar solutions.

                One of the most common errors is "Permission denied." This means you don't have permission to access that file or folder. Linux sets access permissions for each file for security, and this error occurs when regular users try to modify system files. The solution is to add sudo before the command to execute with administrator privileges.

                The "No such file or directory" error means the specified file or folder doesn't exist. It occurs when you've entered the wrong file name or the file is in a different location. Use the ls command to check files in the current location and the pwd command to check your current location.

                The "Command not found" error means the command you entered doesn't exist or isn't installed. It occurs when you've entered the wrong command name or the program isn't installed. You can solve it by installing the necessary program using a package manager.

                Network-related errors also occur frequently. "Connection refused" means the server you're trying to connect to isn't responding, and "Network unreachable" means there's a problem with the network connection itself. In such cases, you need to check internet connection status and firewall settings.

                When errors occur, don't panic and read the error message carefully. Most error messages tell you the cause of the problem and the direction for solution. Searching for error messages on Google can help you find solutions from people who've experienced similar problems.

                <div class="title" id="domain">What is a Domain?</div>
                A domain is a name that makes internet addresses easy for people to remember. In reality, all websites have IP addresses made of numbers like 192.168.1.1, but it's very difficult to remember such numbers. That's why we use meaningful names like siliod.com, google.com, which are domains.

                Domains have a hierarchical structure. Taking www.google.com as an example, com is the top-level domain, google is the second-level domain, and www is the subdomain. It's similar to the order of country, city, district, and neighborhood in addresses. Thanks to this hierarchical structure, countless websites worldwide can be systematically managed.

                To use a domain, you need to purchase it from a domain registration company. Domains are rented in the form of paying annual usage fees. Popular domain names can be expensive, and if someone else is already using them, you can't purchase them. After purchasing a domain, you need to connect it to the actual server's IP address through DNS settings.

                The biggest advantage of domains is that they're easy to remember. You can use meaningful names instead of numerical IP addresses, which also helps with branding. Also, even if you move your server to another location, the domain name can remain the same, so users can continue to access using the same address.

                The fact that services like Siliod provide domains for free is a huge advantage. Generally, domains cost anywhere from 10,000 to tens of thousands of won annually, so it's a valuable benefit that reduces initial cost burden, especially for individual developers or startups. With free domains, you can more easily start and operate web projects.

                <div class="title" id="https">The Importance of HTTPS</div>
                HTTPS is a technology that encrypts and protects communication between websites and users. While traditional HTTP transmits information as-is, which can be intercepted by someone in the middle, HTTPS encrypts all information for secure transmission.

                Think about entering credit card information when shopping online. If such important information is transmitted without encryption, hackers could intercept it in the middle and misuse it. HTTPS converts this information into complex encryption before transmission, so even if intercepted in the middle, the original content cannot be known.

                Another important role of HTTPS is verifying the identity of websites. Through something called SSL certificates, you can verify whether this website is really trustworthy. Fake bank sites or phishing sites mostly don't have legitimate certificates, so they either don't use HTTPS or browsers show warning messages.

                Nowadays, search engines like Google also rate websites that use HTTPS higher. HTTPS has become almost essential for appearing high in search results. Also, modern browsers display a "Not Secure" warning when visiting websites that don't use HTTPS.

                In the past, purchasing and setting up SSL certificates was complex and expensive. But now there are free certificate services like Let's Encrypt that allow anyone to easily use HTTPS. Services like Siliod that automatically issue certificates are really convenient features. Because developers can create secure websites without going through complex certificate setup processes. Thanks to this automation, more websites use HTTPS, and overall internet security improves.

                <div class="title" id="webserver">What is a Web Server?</div>
                A web server is a computer program that provides websites on the internet. Like a librarian in a library, when users request web pages, it finds and delivers the corresponding files.

                When we type an address into a browser and press enter, at that moment we're sending a request to the web server saying "please show me this page." The web server receives this request, finds the corresponding HTML files, images, CSS files, etc., and transmits them to our browser. Then the browser receives these files and creates the web page we see.

                There are several types of web servers. The most famous are Apache and Nginx. Apache is an old and stable web server that provides many features. Nginx is relatively new but popular for its fast speed and low memory usage. There are also various other web servers like Microsoft's IIS and Google's Tomcat.

                What web servers do isn't just delivering files. They verify user authentication, record logs, manage security, and handle multiple user requests simultaneously. They also execute dynamic web pages written in programming languages like PHP or Python and deliver the results.

                Linux is very suitable for operating web servers. It has excellent stability, strong security, and can be used for free. Most websites worldwide run on Linux servers. Installing and managing web servers is also very simple in Linux through package managers. You can install a web server with just one line: sudo apt install apache2, and immediately start operating a website.

                Understanding web servers helps you know how the internet works and how websites are created. Linux and web servers are core technologies of the modern internet, and learning them can build the foundation for web development and server management.

                <div class="title" id="443port">How to Use Port 443 in Siliod</div>
                In Siliod, port 443 is used by default when connecting to instances.<br>
                Therefore, to use port 443 for HTTPS, etc., you need to change the instance connection port to 8443, etc.<br><br>

                <strong>Port 443</strong>: This is the standard port for HTTPS (HTTP Secure).<br>
                It's the port that web browsers use by default for SSL/TLS encrypted connections.<br>
                Since it's a system port (1-1023), sudo privileges are required when using it.<br><br>

                <strong>How to Modify Instance Connection Port</strong><br><br>
                
                <strong>1.1 For GUI, modify start.sh</strong><br>
                Change the port in existing settings to 8443:<br>
                Open <code>/home/ubuntu/.novnc/start.sh</code> and modify the last option on the last line<br>
                Existing setting:<br>
                <code>..... --listen 443</code><br>
                Modified setting:<br>
                <code>..... --listen 8443</code><br><br>
                
                <strong>1.2 For CLI, modify Crontab settings</strong><br>
                Change the port in existing settings to 8443:<br>
                <code>crontab -e</code><br>
                Existing setting:<br>
                <code>@reboot sudo /home/ubuntu/.ttyd/build/ttyd --port 443 --ssl .....</code><br>
                Modified setting:<br>
                <code>@reboot sudo /home/ubuntu/.ttyd/build/ttyd --port 8443 --ssl .....</code><br><br>
                
                <strong>2. Open Port in Dashboard</strong><br>
                Proceed step by step:<br>
                - Select instance: Click to select the corresponding instance<br>
                - Bottom more menu: Click the "More" button at the bottom of instance details<br>
                - Port settings: Go to Network/Security settings menu<br><br>

                Add TCP 8443 port:<br>
                - Protocol: TCP<br>
                - Port: 8443<br>
                - Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (allow all IPs) or restrict as needed<br><br>

                <strong>3. Restart Instance</strong><br>
                Once configuration is complete, restart the instance:<br>
                - From dashboard:<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Select instance<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Click "Restart Instance" button<br><br>
                - Or from terminal:<br>
                <code>sudo reboot</code><br><br>

                <strong>4. Verify Connection</strong><br>
                After restart, verify connection by accessing the following URL:<br>
                <code>https://{instance-id}.siliod.com:8443</code><br><br>

                <strong>If you want to create an HTTPS server</strong><br>
                In Siliod, domains and TLS certificates are automatically generated when creating instances, so there's no need to issue certificates again separately.<br><br>

                SSL(TLS) certificate paths:<br>
                - Certificate file: <code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/{instance-id}.siliod.com/fullchain.pem</code><br>
                - Private key file: <code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/{instance-id}.siliod.com/privkey.pem</code><br><br>

                Command to check certificate files:<br>
                <code>sudo ls -la /etc/letsencrypt/live/{instance-id}.siliod.com/</code><br>

                <div class="title" id="storage">I Want to Increase Storage Capacity</div>
                <strong>1. Add Storage Capacity</strong><br>
                Proceed step by step:<br>
                - Select instance: Click to select the corresponding instance<br>
                - Bottom more menu: Click the "More" button at the bottom of instance details<br>
                - Storage capacity: Increase capacity as desired and click "Add Capacity" button (reducing capacity is not possible)<br><br>

                <strong>2. Storage Resizing</strong><br>
                In Linux, you cannot immediately use the capacity even after increasing hardware capacity.<br><br>

                First, check existing storage capacity with <code>df -h</code>, then<br>

                <code>sudo growpart /dev/nvme0n1 1</code><br>
                <code>sudo resize2fs /dev/nvme0n1p1</code><br>
                Enter these commands to resize storage, then<br><br>

                Check the changed storage capacity again with <code>df -h</code>
            </div>
        </div>
